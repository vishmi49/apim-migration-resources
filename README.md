This repository is used to maintain the migration client for WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M).
The migration client is used when users of older versions of the WSO2 API manager migrates to a newer version.
In addition, pre-validators are provided to verify the integrity of the data in the older version before migration, to avoid failures at migration time.

To migrate to the latest version:
- Visit the [latest documentation](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/install-and-setup/upgrading-wso2-api-manager/upgrading-guidelines/)
- Follow the given instructions

Make sure to refer to the documentation of the version you want to migrate to, if you are not migrating to the latest version.
